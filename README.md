# Pipeliam-External
A pipeline built for Blender, but is external, with registration keys and linked to google drive.

To change the google drive access : Create in the function folder a "credentials.json" by enabeling the API of google sheets. Change the "sheet_id" at the top of the "login_function.py" to match it to your correspondant sheet. 
Build the following Sheet like this :

Just enter the username and a password in the correspondant cells.
And you should have an access login to google drive. 

PIPELIAM - EXTERNAL v0.1 is still in progress, which means there is nothing much right now but soon will be added nice features as reviews for artists, task management and scene launchers. Please be sure to follow that github for more content !
